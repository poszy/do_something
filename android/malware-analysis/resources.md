## Stuff I can build

- we recommend that reverse engineers build tools to pinpoint anti-analysis techniques in apps.

- Over time, serious Android reverse engineers should build a more robust solution for this task that is mapping permissions to apis 

- Newer malware is written kotlin, flutter and other frameworks/ languages. future malware analysis will require tools to analyze the new apps. 

- For searching purposes, develop a regular expression to return all the interesting strings and method names that you can think of. This might include the names of SMS or contact list APIs, as well as strings that match URLs or interesting content providers.. such as searching for "d.*" pacakge.
